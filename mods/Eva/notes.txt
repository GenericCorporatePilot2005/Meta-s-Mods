So it's possible to have banter between pilots.
We can have a pilot talk to a "target" (if Shinji moving next to Rei triggers a dialog, Rei is the target), an "other" pilot (if Shinji moves next to Rei, Asuka can get pissy about it), or a CEO (Gendo/Misato depending on which we have act as the CEO)
These can be longer exchanges than in vanilla, you can have A->B->A->B->... talk.
Dialogs can be unique (only triggering once per playthrough) and have odds (if something is not unique, you don't necessarily want to see it every single time)
Possible conditions that trigger banter:
- PawnDamaged, PawnHealed
- PawnFire, PawnExtinguished
- PawnAcided, PawnUnacided
- PawnFrozen, PawnUnfrozen
- PawnGrappled, PawnUngrappled
- PawnShielded, PawnUnshielded
- PawnBoosted, PawnUnboosted
- PawnSelected, PawnDeselected
- PawnKilled, PawnRevived
Possible rules to check:
- Personality (this is Kai/Shinji/Rei)
- Weapon (pawn has a Positron Rifle equipped)
- Mech (pawn is in the Swap Mech; not super relevant here since pilot == mech; I think this can also be used to detect specific enemy types, like "moved next to Kaworu")
- MechClass (pawn is in a Prime-class mech; not super relevant since they are all Cyborgs)
- HealthLower, HealthGreater (oh no Rei is hurt; finishing off an angel)
- Not, And, Or (to combine rules)

Example of possible dialogs to trigger:
- Shinji moves next to Kaworu, is carrying a prog knife, and Kaworu is no longer unkillable.
- Rei is carrying the Spear of Longinus and rambles to herself
