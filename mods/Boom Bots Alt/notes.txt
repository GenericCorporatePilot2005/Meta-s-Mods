This is for nonobvious tricks you can use with this squad.
- The artillery can slam Vek into itself; its death effect triggers the sticky bomb it just applied.
- The smart lasers hit the cell you click first. You can shield a building, trigger an adjacent sticky, and the building is safe.
- The cannon's recoil lets you deal massive damage in open maps.
- Often, the cannon bot's corpse will be on a fire tile, dooming it after you revive it. An easy fix is to use recoil to be propelled into water.
- You can use fire to get your bots to explode at the start of the enemy's turn, finishing them off.
- Add stickies on your own bots when possible; this increases their self-destruct damage.
