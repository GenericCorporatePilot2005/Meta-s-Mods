v1.0.1
- Omega Leaper has 2 HP, down from 3. Being stable and smartly webbing mechs makes it harder to handle/kill already.
- Omega Scarab has 2 movement, down from 3. It already autohits all mechs; its main shot should be slightly worse.
- Brought many Omega statlines in line with the Alpha version.
- Fixed an issue where some regular, non-Alpha Starfishes would have 1 max HP instead of 2.

v1.0
- Release. Each Alpha Vek has its Omega version.
