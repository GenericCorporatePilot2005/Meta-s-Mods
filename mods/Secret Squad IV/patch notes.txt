v0.2
- Sludges now have 2 HP and self-damage 1 when using their weapon.
- Goos can no longer move again after evolving.
- Applying gunk to a goo now evolves it if possible instead of healing it.
- Evolved goos are now correctly owned by the blobber that spawned the unevolved version.
- Evolved goos that were grappled before evolving are now grappled again after evolution.
- When a goo evolves, it now eats all adjacent gunk at once, which makes more sense to the player.
- Gunk items are correctly removed when eaten by goos.
- Remade the Techno-Firefly's weapon entirely to be less buggy and confusing.
- Achievements are go.
