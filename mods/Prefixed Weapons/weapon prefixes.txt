To do:
- Options to disable prefixes separately
- Modifiers

- should check on the max upgrade version of the weapon
Modifiers for prefixes that add core cost should cost cores to equip, we should check they are powered and the fused version can drop

Can use Game:AddWeapon() to add a modifier to the player inventory at game start, check it costs 0 cores
