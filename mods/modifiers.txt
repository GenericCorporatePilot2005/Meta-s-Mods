Modifiers:
After every... boss? you have to pick 1 in 3 modifiers, which affect the rest of the run.
- Forests are on fire.
- Ice is lava.
- N% tiles are cracked.
- Tyrant effect every 2nd turn.
- Add like 50 prefixes to the pool if prefix mod is active.
- Water is chasms.
- Receiving ACID damages your pawns.
- Next time pod contains nothing
- Pilot $N starts battle confused/with 1 HP/on acid/cannot be healed
- All Psions have +1 HP.
- Deployable units die every turn? (would maybe mess with mission units?)
- All enemies leave a corpse.
- All missions last +1 turn.
- All missions last -1 turn.
