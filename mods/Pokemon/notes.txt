local pawn = Board:GetPawn(0) pawn:SetHealth(1) Board:RemovePawn(pawn) Board:AddPawn(pawn, Point(0,0))

This Powershell command helped rename assets
Get-ChildItem -Path . -OutVariable dirs
foreach ($i in $dirs) { Rename-Item $i.name ("Omega"+$i.name) }


Rewrite sleep so that it has a second value: whether damage wakes up the pawn
Blind on mechs: can only use first weapon (by removing the second weapon temporarily)?

Make Rain not put out fires on wildfire (Kartoflame) or Archive's forest mission

Remake Spatial Rend (hit any line on the board, leave item that destroys tile when triggered

Horde prefix - does not count against spawn cap, look at swarmer

cool idea: give the player disposable helper units (helis, tank, artillery, whatever) that cannot harm angels (either explicitly coded in their weapons, or just because they deal 1 damage and the angel is armored); same with environments (reuse archive bombers, but the bombs deal 1 damage to Evas and Angels)
have an environment that drop an N² bomb that takes a turn to explode, you have to force the Angel to stay close to it
